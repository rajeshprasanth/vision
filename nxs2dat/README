This python script converts multiple processed nxs files to ASCII format (.dat files). Copy "nxs2dat.py" to your favorite directory for executable files (such as $HOME/bin). Make sure the directory is in your $PATH.

Enter the following command line to make the script executable

$chmod 755 nxs2dat.py

Then in any directory, type

$nxs2dat.py nxsdir

where nxsdir is the folder containing the nxs files you want to convert (absolute directory needed). The output dat files will be saved in the current directory. 

If you want to specify a directory to save the output files, use

$nxs2dat.py nxsdir asciidir

asciidir needs to be an absolute directory, and if it does not exist, the script will create one.
