This python script converts output from various first-principles codes to .aclimax format. Copy "2climax.py" and "elements.txt" to your favorite directory for executable files (such as $HOME/bin). Make sure the directory is in your $PATH.

Enter the following command line to make the script executable

$chmod 755 2climax.py

Then go to the directory with the file you want to convert

For VASP+Phonopy:
$2climax.py -v POSCAR mesh.yaml

For CASTEP:
$2climax.py -c $seed.phonon

For Quantum Espresso (currently orthorhombic cells only):
$2climax.py -q $seed.ph.out mesh_k matdyn.modes

For Gaussian:
$2climax.py -g $seed.out

By default the output will be in DOS format (newline = '\r\n'), and can be read by aClimax.

The default output file is out.aclimax. If you want to use a different name, add your name of choice to the end of the above command lines.
